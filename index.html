			<h2><b>Guidelines to final report, project proposal and milestone report</b></h2>
			<hr />
		<div id="coursedesc">
			<p>You need to write a project proposal (max 2 pages) and a project report (max 6 pages) for the final project.
				Here is the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/bqpvrgsxnpkt">report template</a>. You are also
				expected to report project milestones.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Project proposal (10%)</b>: Use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/rvfhxvjzhjbc">this
						template</a> to write a 2-page proposal. The proposal should include the problem you are trying
					to solve, why the problem is important, interesting or difficult. Please also include the papers you
					plan to read and the high-level idea of your solution to the problem.</li>
				<li><b>Project milestone (20%)</b>: Use the provided templates <a
						href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/vsxwrfgfvdwx">[Milestone]</a>  to write project milestone
					reports (maximum 2 pages). Each project milestone report contains what you have done in
					reading and coding. </li>
				<li><b>Final report (70%)</b>: The final report is expected to summarize what you have done during the semester. There is no standard format. Please discuss with your project advisor what to write. If you need some ideas, here are some ideas for you to refer.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Originality and creativity</b>: Original and creative ideas are encouraged. </li>
					<li><b>Reference to prior work</b>: Cite existing related work, and discuss the motivation on
						why you work this project and your algorithm or approach. Even you are reproducing a published
						paper, you should have your own motivation. </li>
					<li><b>Technical correctness</b>: Present your algorithms or systems for your project. Provide
						key information for reviewers to judge whether it is technically correct. </li>
					<li><b>Experimental validation</b>: Present your experimental setups, and experiments
						conducted. Discuss the motivation of the designed experimental setups. Describe the project
						evaluation metrics and present details to understand your evaluation. </li>
					<li><b>Analysis quality</b>: Report quantitative results and include qualitative evaluation.
						Analyze and understand your system by inspecting key outputs and intermediate results. Discuss
						how it works, when it succeeds and when it fails, and try to interpret why it works and why not.
					</li>
					<li><b>Clarity in writing</b>: The report is written in a precise and concise manner so the
						report can be easily understood. </li>
					<li><b>Overall quality of report</b>: This is an overall evaluation of the final project
						report, including all dimensions: writing, creativity, convincing experiments and analysis.
					</li>

				</ul>
				<li>I am not a targeted student, may I enroll this course?</li>
				<ul>
					<p>This course is targetted for SDS students of CS program. We are experimenting the course, and may open this for other student groups. Stay tuned.</p>
